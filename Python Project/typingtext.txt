The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Practice makes perfect, so keep on typing.
Knowledge is power, but wisdom is more powerful.
Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
